#summary How to arrange the code from SVN to be able to be compiled

==Prerequisites==

===devkitARM===

Ok, first things first.  You need devkitARM/devkitPro to be able to compile this.  You can follow the instructions on the wiki:

http://wiki.devkitpro.org/index.php/Getting_Started

For Ubuntu users/Linux users in general, this version is more concise:

For Unix (Linux, Mac) in general:

===Get *make*===

For those who don't know, GNU make is a utility/programming language for compilation.  Because I absolutely don't know how to make VC++/XCode compilation files, I'm just supporting makefiles.

For Windows:

For Mac, I think you need to get XCode:

For Linux...you know where it is.

===Get the code from SVN===

All set?  You also need to get an SVN client to download the source code:

I never really use any SVN client other for commits, so don't ask me.

==Compiling==

1) At the l-echo folder: `make setup-nds`

2) Enter the n-echo folder, and: `make`
